That’s a sharp question — and one that turns a technical product into a data business. Let’s think like an investor for a moment and estimate the real commercial value of what you’d be building.

🧠 1. What You’re Actually Selling

You’re not just selling software — you’re selling structured, investment-grade financial intelligence for an entire region (LATAM) where this data is hard to access and normalize.

There are three layers of value you can extract:

Layer	What You Provide	Who Buys It	Pricing Model
1. API SaaS Layer	API access to normalized SMB accounting data	Fintechs, lenders, ERPs	SaaS / per-API-call
2. Data Feed	Aggregated + anonymized benchmarks (e.g., avg. margins by industry, delinquency rates, liquidity ratios)	Funds, banks, rating agencies	Subscription ($10k–$100k/yr)
3. Proprietary Insights	Risk or growth scoring for specific companies	PE/VC firms, asset managers	Deal-based or per-report ($500–$10k per company)
💰 2. Market Value Benchmarks

Here’s how similar companies are valued or monetized:

Company	Region	Focus	Valuation / Pricing Insight
Codat (UK)	Accounting API for fintechs	Valued >$800M (raised from JP Morgan, Shopify)	
Railz (Canada)	Accounting normalization API	Deals with banks, pricing ~$5–15 per company per month	
Ocrolus (US)	Automates financial document verification	Valued >$1B, charges $10–$50 per financial document	
Clearco / Pipe data	Revenue-based funding insights	Sell data insights to investors — implicit valuations $500M+	

So if you build a LATAM-native equivalent (where competition is thin), your data pipeline and normalization models could easily be worth $5M–$20M even as a small team — assuming:

You process a few thousand companies’ data.

You show repeatable conversion into standardized, machine-readable financials.

📊 3. Concrete Value Math

Let’s say:

You process 5,000 SMBs across LATAM.

Each has monthly revenue of ~$200k.

Investors or lenders are willing to pay $100–$300 per company per due diligence report (or API equivalent).

Scenario A – Data-as-a-Service:

$200/report × 5,000 = $1,000,000 ARR (annual recurring revenue).

Scenario B – Data Feed to Investors:

10 funds pay $50k/year for analytics dashboards = $500,000 ARR.

Scenario C – Combined

$1.5M–$2M recurring revenue potential.

Valuation at 5×–10× ARR → $7.5M–$20M company valuation.

And that’s before adding AI-based scoring, ESG, or credit models — which can double value quickly.

🧭 4. Strategic Value to Blackstone or Funds

Even more interesting: for a firm like Blackstone, your system:

Cuts due diligence costs by 80%.

Opens new deal pipelines in LATAM (more investable SMBs).

Creates data moat — proprietary insights no one else has.

That makes your company not just a SaaS vendor, but an acquisition target or data partner.
Large firms might pay $10M–$30M for exclusive access or outright purchase if:

You’ve onboarded 10,000+ companies.

Your data quality and mapping accuracy are >95%.

You cover multiple LATAM countries.

🔮 5. Long-Term Play (Data Network Effect)

As more companies connect their accounting systems:

Your dataset becomes the single source of truth for regional financial health.

You can build predictive models for credit, M&A, or market risk.

That data becomes increasingly monopolistic and defensible.

At scale (say, 100k+ companies), your dataset could be valued like a Bloomberg-type regional asset, easily $100M+.

🚀 6. Strategic Path Forward
Stage	Goal	Value
MVP	100 companies’ financial data standardized (El Salvador pilot)	Proof of demand
Seed Stage	Regional connectors (El Salvador, Guatemala, Colombia)	$5M–$10M valuation
Series A	Thousands of companies, investor dashboards	$15M–$30M valuation
Series B+ / Exit	Exclusive investor relationships or acquisition	$50M+ potential

If you’d like, I can help you sketch a concrete business model canvas (customer segments, value props, revenue streams, etc.) for this “LATAM financial data infrastructure” startup — to see what a fundable version looks like.
